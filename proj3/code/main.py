    '''
    For this project, you will need to report performance for three
    combinations of features / classifiers. We recommend that you code them in
    this order:
        1) Tiny image features and nearest neighbor classifier
        2) Bag of word features and nearest neighbor classifier
        3) Bag of word features and linear SVM classifier
    The starter code is initialized to 'placeholder' just so that the starter
    code does not crash when run unmodified and you can get a preview of how
    results are presented.

    Interpreting your performance with 100 training examples per category:
     accuracy  =   0 -> Something is broken.
     accuracy ~= .07 -> Your performance is equal to chance.
                        Something is broken or you ran the starter code unchanged.
     accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and nearest
                        neighbor classifier. Performance goes up a few
                        percentage points with K-NN instead of 1-NN.
     accuracy ~= .20 -> Rough performance with tiny images and linear SVM
                        classifier. Although the accuracy is about the same as
                        nearest neighbor, the confusion matrix is very different.
     accuracy ~= .40 -> Rough performance with bag of word and nearest
                        neighbor classifier. Can reach .60 with K-NN and
                        different distance metrics.
     accuracy ~= .50 -> You've gotten things roughly correct with bag of
                        word and a linear SVM classifier.
     accuracy >= .70 -> You've also tuned your parameters well. E.g. number
                        of clusters, SVM regularization, number of patches
                        sampled when building vocabulary, size and step for
                        dense features.
     accuracy >= .80 -> You've added in spatial information somehow or you've
                        added additional, complementary image features. This
                        represents state of the art in Lazebnik et al 2006.
     accuracy >= .85 -> You've done extremely well. This is the state of the
                        art in the 2010 SUN database paper from fusing many
                        features. Don't trust this number unless you actually
                        measure many random splits.
     accuracy >= .90 -> You used modern deep features trained on much larger
                        image databases.
     accuracy >= .96 -> You can beat a human at this task. This isn't a
                        realistic number. Some accuracy calculation is broken
                        or your classifier is cheating and seeing the test
                        labels.
